# 🍔 Food Shop Website

## 📝 Introduction

Welcome to my **Food Shop Website** project!
This is a personal learning journey where I’m building a complete web application to showcase and sell delicious food items. The goal is to learn full-stack development while creating a clean, modern, and functional shopping experience.

The project starts with a **frontend-only version**, and later I will build a backend using Node.js.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

* **HTML** – Structure of the website
* **CSS** – Styling
* **JavaScript** – Website logic & interactions
* **React.js** – Component-based UI and reactive rendering

### **Backend (Future)**

* **Node.js** – Server, APIs, and future database integration

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Build a visually appealing food shop interface
* Display food items with images, descriptions, and prices
* Implement navigation and responsive design
* Use React components to handle UI and cart logic
* Expand into a full-stack project using Node.js

---

## 🏗️ How I’m Building This

### **Step 1 — UI Design**

* Basic layout using HTML
* Styling using CSS

### **Step 2 — Add Interactivity**

* JavaScript functions for clicking, filtering, and cart actions

### **Step 3 — Move to React.js**

* Build components (Navbar, Menu, Food Card, Cart, Footer)
* Use React Hooks for state management

### **Step 4 — Backend Development (Future)**

* Create Node.js server
* Build REST APIs
* Connect to a database for orders, users, and cart
